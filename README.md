Movie Recommendations Fe Assignment
This repository contains an assignment for our summer interns'19 candidates.

Description:
Changes are added to the front-end.

Ideation:
This code is for the front-end we will be using with our movie recommendations engine, which is currently work in progress. Simply through this game application, users can visit the website (for which this is the front-end), where they can rate several movies and subscribe to our service. In return at the end of each month we will send them recommended movies that we think they would like the most - based on the ratings they have provided previously. There are of course lots of other features that we don't tell here ;) we'll keep it a surprise when they are implemented.
